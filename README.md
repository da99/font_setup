Note:
====================================

The hinting of some fonts may not look right.
It is usually because of the size.
For example, trying setting the font to 12 in Terminator.

Fonts:
========
* boxxy font best used at size 14 medium/normal
* ctrld-font font best used at size 13 medium/normal
